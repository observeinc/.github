# Contributing

**Status:** Frozen

This repository is "frozen" to major changes. Bug fixes and feature additions to existing workflows will be accepted, but breaking changes are strongly discouraged and new workflows should not be added.

Moving forward, each workflow or group of tightly coupled workflows should be hosted in separate repositories. This enables:

* Versioning with tags
* Integration testing
